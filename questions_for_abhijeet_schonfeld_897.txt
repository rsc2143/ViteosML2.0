dummyk['remove_mark_fin'] = dummyk.apply(lambda x :remove_mark_notolerance(x['pos_qnt_diff'] ,x['Cash Standing'],x['len_cash']),axis = 1)

In above code line, what if the columns for Cash Standing and len cash have null values? Asking since we are not imputing null values with anything for these two columns.
For column pos_qnt_diff, we impute with 0, so that's okay.
